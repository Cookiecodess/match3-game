# A Raylib learning project

I've always been super interested in programming video games, especially retro-style ones.

This [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7PMA3X1tf8) is a great start for me! This project uses Raylib, a video game programming library written in C.

I used this [Raylib quickstart template](https://github.com/raylib-extras/raylib-quickstart) to build Raylib before starting writing any actual code for the game.

## My own features

For most of this project, at least till now, I have followed along with the tutorial. But these are some features that I'm very proud to say that I have implemented on my own :)

- Highlight tiles in white on hover
- Press-drag-and-release to swap tiles
