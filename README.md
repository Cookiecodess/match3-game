# A Raylib learning project

I've always been super interested in programming video games, especially retro-style ones.

This is a great start for me! This project uses C, a language I'm okay with, and Raylib, a video game programming library.

## My own features

For most of this project, at least till now, I have followed along with the tutorial. But these are some of the features that I'm very say I have implemented myself :)
